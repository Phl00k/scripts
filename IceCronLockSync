#rsync 
#rsync (Everyone seems to like -z, but it is much slower for me)

#a: archive mode - rescursive, preserves owner, preserves permissions, preserves modification times, preserves group, copies symlinks as symlinks, preserves device files.
#H: preserves hard-links
#A: preserves ACLs
#X: preserves extended attributes
#x: don't cross file-system boundaries
#v: increase verbosity
#--numeric-ds: don't map uid/gid values by user/group name
#--delete: delete extraneous files from dest dirs (differential clean-up during sync)
#--progress: show progress during transfer
#ssh

#T: turn off pseudo-tty to decrease cpu load on destination.
#c arcfour: use the weakest but fastest SSH encryption. Must specify "Ciphers arcfour" in sshd_config on destination.
#o Compression=no: Turn off SSH compression.
#x: turn off X forwarding if it is on by default.
